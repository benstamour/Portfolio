Benjamin St. Amour's Portfolio
==============================

Web Development Projects
========================

[My Portfolio Website](https://github.com/benstamour/portfolio-website)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository includes the code for my portfolio site (which can be visited **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com)**), made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This project involved me experimenting with combinations of colour, typography, and shapes with the goal of creating a site that is appealing and unified. On this website, you can find links to my other projects, along with an overview of my skills, experience, and education.

[Sci-Fi Store Website](https://github.com/benstamour/starsprinter)
------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository includes the code for a responsive website for a fictional sci-fi store, made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Bootstrap. This project involved me working a lot with PHP and building and querying relational databases using MySQL, and I worked on making the site unified and appealing as well as functional, where features include a search catalogue with pagination and sortable results, a login system, the ability for users to add items to a cart and "purchase" them, and the administrative ability to add and edit items to the catalogue. You can visit the site **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/starsprinter)**.

[Bomb Defusing Game](https://github.com/benstamour/cyberbomb)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This repository features a collaborative game in which one player sees a bomb with a timer and a series of modules, while all of the others see a manual with instructions on how to defuse the bomb. The goal is for the person with the bomb to successfully defuse it before time expires, but in order to do so, they need help from their teammates to instruct them on how to defuse it. Each bomb features a different version of each module along with a different set of instructions to follow. This project was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/cyberbomb)** or by downloading the build folder in the repository.

[Mastermind Game](https://github.com/benstamour/mastermind)
-----------------------------------------------------------

This project features a game of Mastermind, in which the player attempts to guess a randomly generated four-digit code. With each guess, the computer tells the player both the number of digits in their guess that are in the code in the correct position (in red) and the number of digits in their guess that are in the code but in a different position (in grey). It was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/mastermind)**. The repository also features both the build folder and the source CSS and JavaScript files.

[Feud Game](https://github.com/benstamour/feud)
-----------------------------------------------

In this game, you are given one category with several answers that all fit in that category. The player's goal is to guess each of the answers before accumulating five strikes (incorrect guesses), which ends the game. Each answer has an individual point value associated with it, and the player gets the corresponding amount of points for each answer they guess correctly. This game was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/feud)** with a sample dataset. I also used animations and keyframes in CSS for the strikes and sliding reveals. The repository features the source files and instructions on how to run a local version and customize the app to feature your own category and answers.

[Trivia Game](https://github.com/benstamour/trivia)
---------------------------------------------------

This project features a trivia game, with a grid of questions each worth a different number of points and relating to a different category. When the user clicks on one of the blue question tiles, they are given a question to answer, and if they get it correct, the value of the question is added to their score. This was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/trivia)**. The repository features the source files and instructions on how to run a local version and customize the app to feature your own questions and categories.

[Vigenère Cipher](https://github.com/benstamour/vigenere)
---------------------------------------------------------

This repository is my first project using Vue.js; it contains a program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigenère cipher. You can access the webpage **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/vigenere)**.

[Circuit Puzzle](https://github.com/benstamour/circuitpuzzle)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This repository is my second project using Vue.js; it contains a program to randomly generate a puzzle involving grid of tiles, some of which can be rotated. To solve the puzzle, the tiles must be rotated in such a way that they create a path connecting the start and end points. The grid may also feature numbered portals, which will connect the path with the matching portal on the grid. The puzzle is randomly generated each time the page is loaded. You can play it online **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/circuit)**.

Game Development Projects
=========================

[The Space Base](https://github.com/benstamour/spacebase)
---------------------------------------------------------

This is my fourth Unity 3D platformer project; to improve upon my previous games, I implemented passcodes in some areas that must be discovered and entered by the player, as well as a large puzzle to be solved, and I also implemented a gravity reversal feature and scripted a sequence of consecutive enemy attacks. I also experimented with different assets to make better-looking menus and scenes. I designed and created the arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, animations, textures, audio, lighting, and editing 3D models (sculpting, posing, and modifying vertices). The repository contains a link to download the build and instructions to play the game alongside the source code, and **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/spacebase/)** also features the download link with some images of the game and a list of assets I used.

[Castle of the Clouds](https://github.com/benstamour/castle-of-the-clouds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my third Unity 3D platformer project; to improve upon my previous games, I created new types of obstacles and experimented with different assets to make better-looking menus and scenes. I designed and created the arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, animations, textures, audio, lighting, and editing 3D models (sculpting, posing, and modifying vertices). The repository contains a link to download the build and instructions to play the game alongside the source code, and **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/castle/)** also features the download link with some images of the game and a list of assets I used.

[The Fortress](https://github.com/benstamour/the-fortress)
----------------------------------------------------------

This is my second 3D Unity platformer, following The Dungeon; to expand on my first game, I worked with more intricate obstacles and triggers, along with a save point feature, and I experimented with different lighting types and placements. I designed and created the arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, animations, textures, audio, lighting, and editing 3D models (sculpting, posing, modifying vertices, and arranging scenes). The repository contains a link to download the build and instructions to play the game alongside the source code, and **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/fortress/)** also features the download link with some images of the game and a list of assets I used.

[The Dungeon](https://github.com/benstamour/dungeon-game)
---------------------------------------------------------

This project is a 3D dungeon platformer game made in Unity, where the player must navigate a series of deadly obstacles in order to get to the end, with the optional additional challenge of collecting each of the ten coloured orbs placed along the player's route. The goal is to make it to the end as fast as possible! I designed and created the dungeon arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, animations, textures, audio, and editing 3D models. The repository contains a link to download the build and instructions to play the game alongside the source code, and **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/dungeon/)** also features the download link with some images of the game and a list of assets I used.

Programming Projects
====================

[Maximum Matching for Bipartite Graphs](https://github.com/benstamour/maximum-matching)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The maxmatching.py file can take any bipartite graph and output a maximum matching for that graph, implementing an algorithm featured in my graph theory class by converting it to Python code. It is accompanied by a Jupyter Notebook file which explains the concepts with accompanying images and illustrates a sample run of the program.

[Data Classification](https://github.com/benstamour/machine-learning)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This project features a .py file that uses three classifiers on the iris dataset from scikit-learn to determine which one yields the most accurate results. It also generates a graph to visualize the data used. There is a Jupyter Notebook file alongside it that displays the output of a sample run of the program.
