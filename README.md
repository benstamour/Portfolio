[Maximum Matching Project](https://github.com/benstamour/maximum-matching)
==========================================================================

The maxmatching.py file can take any bipartite graph and output a maximum matching for that graph, implementing an algorithm featured in my graph theory class by converting it to Python code. It is accompanied by a Jupyter Notebook file which explains the concepts with accompanying images and illustrates a sample run of the program.

[Mastermind Game](https://github.com/benstamour/mastermind)
===========================================================

This project features a game of Mastermind, in which the player attempts to guess a randomly generated four-digit code. With each guess, the computer tells the player both the number of digits in their guess that are in the code in the correct position (in red) and the number of digits in their guess that are in the code but in a different position (in grey). It was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online [here](https://bensta.epizy.com/mastermind). The repository also features both the build folder and the source CSS and JavaScript files.

[Machine Learning](https://github.com/benstamour/machine-learning)
===========================================================

This project features a .py file that uses three classifiers on the iris dataset from scikit-learn to determine which one yields the most accurate results. It also generates a graph to visualize the data used. There is a Jupyter Notebook file alongside it that displays the output of a sample run of the program.
